# ggen Self-Host Pack

This pack makes the `ggen` repository a first-class consumer of its own manufacturing system.

```text
exact Git tree
→ raw over-observation
→ Git-object byte semantics
→ live authority/load-path normalization
→ independent verification
→ admitted RDF
→ ggen pack resolution + gates
→ repository census and authority ledgers
→ gall-core checkpoint and work-item graph
→ generated Jira, LLM work orders, scheduler, handoff, receipts, and replay
→ ggen receipt
→ second-sync byte identity
```

## Authority boundary

The observer is a deliberately small bootstrap kernel. It may read Git and tracked file bytes and may write only under `self-host/`. It cannot call cloud APIs, mutate Git, update trackers, or decide promotion standing.

- `observe_repository.py` deliberately over-observes every tracked file, manifest, marker, and potential output.
- `observe_exact_tree.py` binds symlinks and gitlinks to Git semantics and refuses ambient host-file traversal.
- `normalize_observation.py` applies Chesterton's fence: archives, templates, fixtures, evidence, and dormant nested consumers remain visible but do not become live obligations merely because they contain generated text.
- `observe_self_host.py` is the only supported executor and composes the three stages.
- `verify_observation.py` independently reconstructs the exact Git object set and verifies every observed byte and receipt binding.

All human-facing repository reports are self-host-pack projections. All implementation planning and automation are `gall-core-pack` projections. The observer emits facts once; there is no second handwritten backlog or Jira authority.

## Lifecycle

```bash
cargo build -p ggen-cli-lib --bin ggen
python3 -m unittest discover -s self-host/tests -p 'test_*.py' -v
python3 self-host/scripts/observe_self_host.py
python3 self-host/scripts/verify_observation.py
cd self-host
../target/debug/ggen sync run
../target/debug/ggen receipt verify
bash scripts/gall/gall automation validate
bash scripts/gall/gall work next
bash scripts/gall/gall work dispatch GGEN-DOGFOOD-CENSUS
bash scripts/gall/run-checkpoints.sh
bash scripts/gall/gall receipt verify
../target/debug/ggen sync run
../target/debug/ggen receipt verify
```

Before observation, the seed ontology must be refused by `010_observation_complete.rq`. Planning mode may contain blocking findings and generates the complete Gall retrofit program. The automation profile is deliberately `PlanOnly` plus `HandoffOnly`; no coding agent, tracker, Git, or cloud mutation is authorized by this checkpoint.

A crown is separately asserted only after the generated work items close, blocking findings reach zero, every live generated output has one owner, and clean replay is independently recorded.

## What this first checkpoint changes

It replaces handwritten repository review as the authority for mechanical facts. Cargo members, package identities, packs, templates, workflows, scripts, generated markers, output claims, and layout drift are observed from the exact revision. Existing authored architecture prose remains judgment, not fabricated observation.
