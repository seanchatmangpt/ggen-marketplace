# ash_onetime

`ash_onetime` is an Ash extension for explicit keyed-effect semantics. It separates
replay-safe idempotency from collision-rejecting one-time nonces and uses PostgreSQL as the
authoritative admissions store.

## What it does

Every protected action declares one strategy and a nonempty scope. PostgreSQL admits exactly
once per key under the declared scope; the unique constraint — not application code — decides
concurrent races. There is no admission pre-read.

- **`:idempotency`** — execute the effect once per key, store the classified response, and
  replay it verbatim on retries within the retention boundary. A conflicting fingerprint
  (same key, different request) is terminal and never re-executes. The effect, the admission
  claim, and the encoded response commit or roll back together in the action's transaction.
- **`:one_time_nonce`** — authenticate a single opportunity and reject every collision. The
  spend lives and dies with the action transaction by default; a retry must bear a fresh proof.
- **`commit: :independent`** (nonce, opt-in, RFC 9449 §11.1) — the DPoP replay fence. The
  nonce claim commits in its own transaction *before* the action body runs, so a downstream
  failure cannot make the proof reusable. A reused proof is rejected with `:nonce_already_used`
  for the acceptance window. Default-off; existing nonce consumers are byte-for-byte unchanged.

Optional, non-admitting surfaces: a response cache, a Plug, Oban workers for cleanup and
forward partition creation, and an external-effect execute/recover protocol for peers that
need to observe or reverse a side effect.

## When to use this vs. hand-rolled idempotency

Use `ash_onetime` when you need a *correct* admission layer for effectful Ash actions and do
not want to re-derive the failure modes a hand-rolled table-plus-flag approach ships with.

- **The correctness guarantee:** a PostgreSQL-authoritative, once-per-key local effect and
  typed replay within the declared retention boundary. The effect, the admission claim, and
  the encoded response commit or roll back together in the action's existing transaction;
  there is no admission pre-read, so the unique constraint — not application code — decides
  concurrent races. A conflicting fingerprint is terminal and never re-executes.
- **What it replaces:** the bespoke idempotency-key table, the "did this already run?"
  pre-check that races under concurrency, the stored-response schema you have to version and
  re-encode, the fingerprint binding you have to remember to update, and the silent
  double-execution that lands when you forget. Each of these is a class of bug this library
  was built to make impossible at the boundary.
- **When NOT to use it:** read-only or non-transactional actions (the library rejects them),
  resources without AshPostgres (PostgreSQL is the authoritative store; there is no
  fallback), and workloads that need end-to-end exactly-once *delivery* rather than
  once-per-key *local admission* (delivery is a separate concern — see
  [External effects](documentation/external-effects.md)). If you have no effectful action to
  protect, there is nothing to admit.

## Quick start

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Charge do
  use Ash.Resource,
    domain: MyApp.Domain,
    data_layer: AshPostgres.DataLayer,
    extensions: [AshOnetime.Resource]

  postgres do
    table "charges"
    repo MyApp.Repo
  end

  attributes do
    uuid_primary_key :id
    attribute :account_id, :uuid, allow_nil?: false, public?: true
    attribute :amount, :integer, allow_nil?: false, public?: true
  end

  actions do
    defaults [:read]

    create :charge do
      transaction? true
      argument :idempotency_key, :string, allow_nil?: false
      accept [:account_id, :amount]
    end

    # A DPoP-protected redemption: the proof's spend survives a downstream failure.
    action :redeem, :integer do
      transaction? true
      argument :value, :integer, allow_nil?: false
      argument :proof, :string, allow_nil?: false
      run MyApp.Redeem
    end
  end

  onetime do
    protect :charge do
      strategy :idempotency
      scope([{:static, "charge"}, {:attribute, :account_id}])
      key({:client, :idempotency_key})
      fingerprint(attributes: [:account_id, :amount])
      response(MyApp.ChargeCodec, fields: [:id, :account_id, :amount], classify: MyApp.Classifier)
      retention({24, :hour})
    end

    protect :redeem do
      strategy :one_time_nonce
      scope([{:static, "redeem"}])
      key({:verified, :proof, MyApp.ProofVerifier})
      window(max_age: {5, :minute}, clock_skew: {30, :second})
      commit :independent   # RFC 9449 §11.1 replay fence (omit for the default :with_action)
    end
  end
end
```

Install with `mix ash_onetime.install` (Igniter-powered) — it wires the repo, generates the
migration, and sets up the schema. See the
[Getting started guide](documentation/getting-started.md) for the full walkthrough.

## Try it

Runnable Livebook notebooks — one per concern — walk through each strategy against a real
PostgreSQL. Open them in [Livebook](https://livebook.dev), set `DATABASE_URL`, and run every
cell. Each notebook's code is regression-pinned so it never ships broken.

- [Idempotency](documentation/livebooks/idempotency.livemd) — fresh execution, replay, fingerprint conflict.
- [One-time nonces](documentation/livebooks/nonces.livemd) — spend, reuse rejection, and the `commit: :independent` replay fence.
- [External effects and recovery](documentation/livebooks/external-recovery.livemd) — the execute/recover protocol.

See [Security model](documentation/security.md) for the authority and fail-closed contract,
and [Recipes](documentation/recipes.md) for end-to-end payment, webhook, and redemption
patterns.

## Status

The package is [published on Hex](https://hex.pm/packages/ash_onetime) as v1.0.0 and the
[source is public](https://github.com/baselabs/ash_onetime). Every protected action chooses
`:idempotency` or `:one_time_nonce` and declares a nonempty scope; there is no default
strategy or global scope fallback. PostgreSQL-authoritative admission, transactional Ash
execution, typed replay, fail-closed nonce spending, signed tokens, external-effect recovery,
bounded cleanup, optional cache/Plug/Oban integrations, the DPoP replay fence, and release
gates are present.

## Compatibility

- Elixir `~> 1.20` (developed and tested on 1.20.2)
- Erlang/OTP 29
- Ash `>= 3.31.3` and `< 4.0.0` (the whole 3.x line from the 3.31.3 floor up)
- AshPostgres 2
- PostgreSQL 18 for the project test harness

The floor is Ash 3.31.3, not the earlier 3.x line: EEF-CVE-2026-55736 (private
action arguments settable by user input, fixed in 3.29.3),
EEF-CVE-2026-70395 (predicate injection in `manage_relationship` belongs_to
lookup disclosing secret lookup keys, fixed in 3.31.1), EEF-CVE-2026-69659
(memory exhaustion via unbounded keyset-cursor deserialization, fixed in
3.31.1), and EEF-CVE-2026-67579 (filter expression injection via a forged
keyset pagination cursor — HIGH, fixed only in 3.31.3) all affect Ash below
3.31.3 — a security library must not admit a vulnerable floor. Compatibility
across the range is verified per matrix cell by the standard gate battery — format,
compile with warnings-as-errors, `mix hex.audit` (Hex security advisories),
`mix deps.audit`, the full test suite, `mix credo --strict`, `mix dialyzer`,
`mix docs --warnings-as-errors`, and `mix hex.build` — run against the 3.31.3 floor
and the latest published Ash 3.x. The release battery (mutation matrix,
unpacked-package check, DSL cheat-sheet freshness) runs once per push in the
`release-checks` job against the committed lock, not per cell.
`.github/workflows/ci.yml` is configured to re-run this matrix on every push and
pull request. The pinned development runtime is Elixir 1.20.2 / Erlang/OTP 29
(`.tool-versions`).

## Development

Start the dedicated test database and run the suite as documented in
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), then:

```sh
mix deps.get
DATABASE_URL=ecto://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:18841/ash_onetime_test mix test
```

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the complete gate battery and
[usage-rules.md](usage-rules.md) for non-negotiable integration boundaries.
The [Getting started guide](documentation/getting-started.md) covers installing the package
and protecting your first action.

## Handling results at the call boundary

A protected action's failure carries a typed `:code` that survives the Ash pipeline, and its
success carries a replayed-vs-fresh signal. Both are observable after `Ash.create/2` /
`Ash.run_action/2` returns:

```elixir
case Ash.create(changeset) do
  {:ok, record} ->
    # 201 on fresh execution (replayed? == false), 200 + Idempotent-Replayed on retry (true).
    status = if AshOnetime.replayed?(record), do: 200, else: 201

  {:error, error} ->
    # The typed code reaches the caller — map it to HTTP.
    case AshOnetime.Error.code(error) do
      :nonce_already_used -> {:conflict, "nonce was already used"}
      :key_reused_with_different_request -> {:conflict, "key reused with a different request"}
      :request_in_progress -> {:conflict, "request is already processing"}
      nil -> {:internal_server_error, "unexpected error"}
    end
end
```

`AshOnetime.replayed?/1` is tri-state: `true` (tracked replay), `false` (tracked fresh), or
`nil` (untracked execution, primitive-return action, or unprotected — see
[Replay](documentation/replay.md)). The full code→HTTP table is in
[Errors](documentation/errors.md).
