# Release Standing — v26.7.19 production.2

## Accepted source standing

- Complete Cargo workspace and local path dependency graph are present.
- The universal core is `no_std`, dependency-free, and forbids unsafe code.
- Japanese TPS domain identifiers remain canonical.
- SHA-256 is used for policy and selection-request receipt identity.
- Selection, authorization, and actuation are separate typed transitions.
- Unix shell, PowerShell, Python, TOML, JSON, and YAML surfaces passed structural parsing.
- The lifecycle generated a 112-target Tier 1/Tier 2 snapshot and dynamically admits additional compiler targets as Tier 3.
- Source SBOM, provenance, checksums, and structural receipts are included under `evidence/source/`.

## Standing not claimed on this host

This artifact-generation host did not contain `cargo`, `rustc`, or `rustup`, and network installation was unavailable. Therefore the following remain unestablished here:

- Rust parsing and type checking;
- rustfmt and Clippy standing;
- unit and integration test execution;
- C ABI smoke execution;
- WebAssembly smoke execution;
- per-target compilation and SDK linkage;
- benchmark measurements;
- signed binary release standing.

The included CI and lifecycle scripts are the required path for establishing those claims. A build receipt is not a test receipt, and a structurally accepted source archive is not a compiled binary release.
