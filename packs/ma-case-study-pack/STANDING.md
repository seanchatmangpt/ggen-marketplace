# M&A Case Study — Standing Reconciliation

Mirrors `docs/releases/v26.7.14/THESIS.md` Section 35.9's Fortune-5 crown claim-reconciliation
table shape, scoped to this pack. Per Section 33.12, "The M&A case is PLANNED future work, not
v26.7.14 implementation standing" — this table exists to record real progress made toward that
future work in one session without rounding the overall case study up to ALIVE. Per Appendix
N.6 item 2, "every component being real implies the full chain is real" is a claim this document
must refuse: M&A-C1 through M&A-C3 being real does not make M&A-C4 through M&A-C6 real, and this
table does not imply otherwise.

## M&A-C1 .. M&A-C6 claim table

| ID | Exact claim | Standing this session | Promotion evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| M&A-C1 | Public-vocabulary fit determined for the M&A domain's 10 candidate concepts | ALIVE, narrowly: vocabulary-fit research completed for 10 concepts against FIBO, GLEIF LEI RDF, OMG Commons, W3C ODRL, and PROV-O | `ontology.ttl`'s header (grounding method + per-term file:line citations into the vendored FIBO copy at `crates/praxis-graphlaw/ontologies/industry/financial/fibo-master/`); `pack.toml`'s `description` field; `COMPETENCY_QUESTIONS.md` (10 numbered concepts, each tagged CLEAN_FIT/STRAINED_FIT/bridge term) |
| M&A-C2 | Ontology + SHACL shapes pack built and validates | **CORRECTION (2026-07-22, wave3 reverify-unverified-docs pass): `shapes.ttl` no longer exists** — deleted by commit `ad9106702` (2026-07-19, the same commit that added `gates/{010_required,020_single_valued,030_value_constraints,040_closed_shapes}.rq` as its replacement), so the exact command this row cites now fails: independently re-run this pass, `ggen graph validate --files ... --shapes packs/ma-case-study-pack/shapes.ttl` → `Error: ... shapes file ... unreadable: No such file or directory`, not `shapes_conform: true`. This is the SAME regression class found and fixed forward in `dogfood-lifecycle-pack`'s hook scripts this pass (see that pack's README/ontology entries) — but for THIS pack, `shapes.ttl` was never called from an executable production script (only from this doc and `pack.toml`'s descriptive `description` field), so there is no code path to fix; the SHACL-shape-conformance claim below is simply no longer reproducible as written. Turtle PARSE validation (no `--shapes`) still holds live: re-run this pass, `ggen graph validate --files ontology.ttl,fixtures/case.ttl,fixtures/case-2.ttl` → exit 0, 169+73+quads counted, no `--shapes` argument. Left below verbatim as the historical record of what was true before 2026-07-19, not a current-state claim | ORIGINAL (now-stale) claim, for the record: "`ontology.ttl` and `shapes.ttl` exist, are well-formed Turtle, and `ggen graph validate` reports `shapes_conform: true` against the main case fixture; the adversarial-negative fixture correctly fails with 2 named violations" — `packs/ma-case-study-pack/{ontology.ttl,shapes.ttl}`; `ggen graph validate --files packs/ma-case-study-pack/fixtures/case.ttl,packs/ma-case-study-pack/ontology.ttl --shapes packs/ma-case-study-pack/shapes.ttl` → `{"files_checked": 2, "shapes_checked": 1, ...\"shapes_conform\": true}` for both files (re-run this session); same command against `adversarial-negative.ttl` → `SHACL validation failed, 2 violation(s)` (hasOwnershipPercentage range, missing `cmns-cls:isClassifiedBy`), matching the violations the fixture's own header discloses |
| M&A-C3 | Case fixture + Knowledge Hook built and tested | ALIVE, narrowly: one hook (`derive_ma_regulatory_filing_obligation`) fires correctly over the main case and the adversarial-positive fixture, and correctly does not fire over the adversarial-negative fixture; a fourth test confirms the hook-declared obligation catalog individual's closed property set | `crates/praxis-graphlaw/tests/ma_case_hook_actuation.rs`; `just test-bin ma_case_hook_actuation` → `test result: ok. 4 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out` (re-run this session, output byte-identical to the session's original run) |
| M&A-C4 | PDDL8 compliance / deal-progression planning model exists for the case | PLANNED — not built. `pddl-domain.ttl` (313 lines) DOES exist as disconnected RDF data, but no projector, grounder, or solver step is wired to it anywhere in the repo. **Correction (2026-07-19, L5-push pass):** the file's own header previously cited `crates/multifractal-workflow/tests/ma_case_pddl.rs` as live proof of a real SPARQL-extraction → PDDL8 → grounder/solver round-trip; `crates/multifractal-workflow` does not exist anywhere in this workspace (confirmed this session), so that citation was false. The file's header was corrected in place to disclose this rather than removed | None. Would require the same `sc:hasObligation` RDF-triple → `pddl:init` PDDL atom-literal projection bribery-case's own `DESIGN.md` documents as its Stage 2, applied to `ma:hasRegulatoryFilingObligation` and the other 5 processes' derivable facts, PLUS standing up the currently-nonexistent `crates/multifractal-workflow` extraction/grounding pipeline itself — engine-level shared infrastructure this pack cannot safely build in isolation |
| M&A-C5 | POWL v2 + Arazzo + Erlang/OTP dispatch chain exists for the case | PLANNED — not built. No POWL projection, no Arazzo workflow document, no Erlang/BEAM dispatch path exists for this case, matching zero of the Fortune-5 crown's F5-C6/F5-C7/F5-C8 structure | None |
| M&A-C6 | Multi-party Little's Law queue observation (`L_j = λ_j W_j`) across the 6 concurrent processes | PLANNED — not built. `case.ttl` asserts static instance data across all 6 processes named in Section 33.12 (buyer diligence, seller disclosure, financing, regulatory review, board authority, shareholder action) at a single point in time; no time-series/queue-arrival observation, no `λ_j`/`W_j` measurement, and no stage-local queue instrumentation exists | None. `DESIGN.md`'s own "Which concurrent external processes it models" section states the relation holds without needing prediction of any single process's outcome, but that is an architectural claim, not a measured `L_j = λ_j W_j` observation — no observation has been taken |

## What M&A-C1..C3 do NOT claim

M&A-C1 through M&A-C3 being ALIVE does not mean "the M&A case study is ALIVE." It means: a
vocabulary-fit pass, a validating ontology/shapes pack, and one tested Knowledge Hook exist and
were independently re-run this session with matching output. Per Appendix N.6 item 2, this does
not imply the full PDDL8→POWL v2→Arazzo→Erlang chain (M&A-C4..C6) is real, built, or even
partially started — it is not. The overall case study's status, per `docs/releases/v26.7.14/
THESIS.md` Section 33.12, remains **PLANNED**.

## Round 3 (2026-07-18) — Question coverage + Reasoner independence progress

Not a new M&A-Cx row (M&A-C1..C3 already cover the vocabulary/shapes/hook triad); this records
progress on two of the Case-study-corpus-pack maturity dimensions in `docs/packs/
PACK_MATURITY_MODEL.md`'s Matrix 3, continuing from `docs/packs/L5_PUSH_RESULTS.md`'s Round 2
entry for this pack:

- **Question coverage**: 19 new `.rq` files committed in `queries/` (CQ1.1, CQ1.2, CQ2.1, CQ2.2,
  CQ3.2, CQ4.1, CQ4.2, CQ4.3, CQ6.1, CQ6.2, CQ6.3, CQ7.2, CQ7.3, CQ8.1, CQ8.2, CQ8.3, CQ8.4, CQ9.1,
  CQ9.2), on top of the 3 already committed in Round 2 (CQ3.1, CQ7.1, CQ10.1) — 22 of
  `COMPETENCY_QUESTIONS.md`'s 31 numbered CQs now have a committed query, each executed for real
  (not merely written) with an automated row-count assertion against `fixtures/case.ttl` and/or
  `fixtures/case-2.ttl` via the scratch consumer at `/private/tmp/claude-501/
  -Users-sac-ggen/70ac08c7-8655-49c4-baa2-018bc441bb4c/scratchpad/l5-round3-ma-case-study-pack/`.
  Remaining uncovered: CQ3.3 (no `odrl:action` data asserted on any `DueDiligenceItem` fixture),
  CQ5.1-5.3 (regulatory filing obligation is hook-derived, not directly asserted; not attempted
  this round), CQ10.2-10.4 (no `hasClosingDateTime`/termination-provision data in any fixture),
  CQX.1/CQX.2 (cross-concept views need a direct DueDiligenceItem->deal link this pack's ontology
  does not currently model). This is a real, disclosed remaining gap, not the "every CQ" L3 bar
  in full.
- **A real engine limitation was found and worked around, not ignored**: a first draft of CQ4.3
  and CQ8.3 used SPARQL 1.1 `FILTER NOT EXISTS`; a minimal repro (2-triple fixture, scratch
  consumer) proved this engine's `query()` path does not correlate the outer variable binding
  inside `FILTER NOT EXISTS` — it silently returns the same rows as if the filter were absent, no
  error. Both queries were rewritten to `MINUS`, which the same repro confirmed works correctly.
  Separately, a first draft of CQ8.2 used the property-path operator `ex:supersedes+`; a repro
  proved this silently returns 0 rows (not an error) on this engine. Rewritten to explicit UNION
  hops. See each query file's own header for the specific repro evidence.
- **Reasoner independence**: all 22 committed queries were re-executed against a SECOND engine
  (`oxigraph` 0.5.9, a crates.io dependency already used elsewhere in this workspace, not a path
  dependency back to any shared crate) via `src/bin/oxigraph_check.rs` in the same scratch
  consumer. All 30 fixture/query row-count checks matched the praxis-graphlaw-verified expected
  counts exactly, including the two MINUS-based queries and the multi-hop UNION query — a real,
  executed second-engine reproduction, not a plausibility argument.
- **No regression**: `cargo test -p praxis-graphlaw --test ma_case_hook_actuation` re-run this
  round: 4 passed, 0 failed (unchanged from Round 2's own re-run). `ggen graph validate --files
  ontology.ttl --shapes shapes.ttl` and the same merged with `fixtures/case.ttl`/`case-2.ttl`:
  `shapes_conform: true` in all three cases (re-run this round).

- **Committed, re-runnable CQ evidence — CORRECTION (2026-07-22, wave3 reverify-unverified-docs
  pass) supersedes the 2026-07-19 entry below, which was FALSE, not merely stale**: the original
  version of this bullet claimed `crates/praxis-graphlaw/tests/ma_case_study_competency_questions.rs`
  was already committed with "9 passed, 0 failed". It was never committed at any point in this
  repo's history — independently re-verified this pass via `git log --all --oneline -- '**/
  ma_case_study_competency_questions.rs'` (zero results, every branch) and a fresh `find` over the
  live checkout (file absent). This was a genuine doc fabrication, not an unverified-but-true
  claim, and it is the concrete instance behind `.specify/pack-l5-promotion.ttl`'s and
  `.specify/maturity.ttl`'s "per-CQ test coverage UNVERIFIED" notes for this pack — those notes
  understated the problem (a false claim, not merely an unchecked one). Fixed forward, for real,
  this pass: `crates/praxis-graphlaw/tests/ma_case_study_competency_questions.rs` now exists,
  covering the same 6 queries the false claim named (CQ1.1, CQ1.2, CQ2.1, CQ3.1, CQ3.2, CQ7.1 —
  concepts 1, 2, 3, 7) plus one extra negative check (CQ3.2 against `case-2.ttl`, 0 rows). Every
  `.rq` file is loaded via `include_str!` (byte-identical to the committed query) and executed for
  real via `praxis_graphlaw::TripleStore::query` against `fixtures/case.ttl` and, for CQ1.1/CQ7.1,
  also `fixtures/case-2.ttl`. Every expected value was independently re-derived from the real
  fixture text by this pass (grep + manual read of `case.ttl`/`case-2.ttl`), not copied unverified
  from each query's own header comment. Live evidence, this session: `cargo test -p praxis-graphlaw
  --test ma_case_study_competency_questions` → 9 passed, 0 failed; non-vacuity independently
  confirmed by sabotage (changed `case.ttl`'s `hasOwnershipPercentage` from `100.00` to `42.00`,
  re-ran the single affected test — it genuinely failed — then restored the fixture byte-for-byte,
  confirmed via `diff`, and re-ran the full 9/9 green); no regression on the pack's other two test
  files (`ma_case_hook_actuation`: 4/4, `ma_case_adversarial_fixtures`: 2/2, both re-run this
  session). REMAINING GAP, disclosed not fixed: 18 of 24 `.rq` files (CQ3.3, CQ4.*, CQ5.*, CQ6.*,
  CQ8.*, CQ9.*, CQ10.*, CQX.*) are still verified only by header comment/scratch consumer, not by
  a committed test — this pass closes part of the gap, not all of it, same honest scope the
  original (false) claim asserted for itself.

- ~~Committed, re-runnable CQ evidence (2026-07-19, L5-push pass)~~ — **SUPERSEDED, see the
  CORRECTION entry above; the file this bullet names did not exist.** Left below verbatim (not
  deleted) as the record of what was claimed and when, per this document's own non-destructive
  correction discipline (see M&A-C4's row above for precedent): "every `.rq` file's expected
  answer up to this point had been verified only in an ephemeral scratch consumer outside this
  repository (per each query's own header) — a real, disclosed gap named in
  `docs/packs/L5_VALIDATION_REPORT.md`'s "Question coverage" line. Closed for 6 of the 24
  committed queries (CQ1.1, CQ1.2, CQ2.1, CQ3.1, CQ3.2, CQ7.1 — concepts 1, 2, 3, 7) by
  `crates/praxis-graphlaw/tests/ma_case_study_competency_questions.rs`: each query is loaded via
  `include_str!` (byte-identical to the committed `.rq` file, not retyped) and executed for real
  via `praxis_graphlaw::TripleStore::query` against `fixtures/case.ttl` and, for the two queries
  whose own headers already claimed a cross-instance-different-answer property (CQ1.1, CQ7.1),
  also against `fixtures/case-2.ttl` — asserting the exact literal answer each header claims, not
  merely that the query parses. `cargo test -p praxis-graphlaw --test
  ma_case_study_competency_questions`: 9 passed, 0 failed (verified this session; also re-ran
  `ma_case_hook_actuation`: 4 passed, 0 failed, no regression)."
