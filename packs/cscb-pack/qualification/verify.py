"""aoq-pack semantic-gate witness court (ggen.semantic-gate-witness-court/1).

Executable arm of gate-court.toml (runner = "python3 qualification/verify.py").

For every gate stem in gates/ (sorted; the directory listing is the truth,
never a hand list):

  pass witness (witnesses/pass/<stem>.ttl): gate must return ZERO violations
  fail witness (witnesses/fail/<stem>.ttl): gate must return >= 1 violation

A gate that cannot flip (0 violations on BOTH witnesses) is a VACUOUS-GATE
failure, never a pass. A missing witness is typed (COURT-BROKEN), never
silent. Violation classes:

  SELECT gate: any row = violation.
  ASK gate:    askAnswer true = violation.

Verdict JSON on stdout. Exit codes:
  0 = CONFORMANT   1 = VIOLATION   2 = COURT-BROKEN (missing witness /
                                             unreadable gate or witness)
