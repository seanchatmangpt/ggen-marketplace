//! Proof test for `chicago-tdd-tools-pack`'s sibling generated file
//! (`tests/chicago_tdd_tools_boundary.rs`, from `cli_boundary_tests.rs.tmpl`).
//!
//! Unlike the pre-2026-07-18 version of this file, `EXPECTED` below is no
//! longer hand-transcribed from `ontology.ttl` inside the `.tmpl` source: it
//! is rendered from the SAME `sparql: tests` query that
//! `cli_boundary_tests.rs.tmpl` runs against `ontology.ttl` in the same
//! `ggen sync` pass. That closes the drift gap the L5 audit named directly
//! (`docs/packs/L5_VALIDATION_REPORT.md`, chicago-tdd-tools-pack, Test
//! generation / Regeneration lifecycle rows): adding, removing, or editing a
//! `ctt:CliBoundaryTest` individual now re-derives both the sibling file AND
//! this proof's expectations from one query path, instead of requiring a
//! second by-hand edit to an `EXPECTED` Rust array baked into the template.
//! `EXPECTED_TEST_COUNT` is `tests.len()` at render time, not a hardcoded `3`.
//!
//! Since 2026-07-19 there IS a reusable in-process artifact: the sibling
//! generated file `tests/chicago_tdd_tools_boundary_runtime.rs` (from
//! `cli_boundary_runtime.rs.tmpl`) defines `run_boundary_spec`, a real
//! dispatch function every generated `#[test]` in
//! `tests/chicago_tdd_tools_boundary.rs` calls via `include!(..)` rather
//! than duplicating CliHarness-spawn-and-assert logic per row. This proof
//! asserts on the CALL SITES (the `BoundarySpec { .. }` literals each
//! generated test builds), not the assertion mechanics themselves — those
//! now live once, in the runtime module, and are exercised for real every
//! time `tests/chicago_tdd_tools_boundary.rs`'s own suite runs.
//!
//! What is still NOT closed, and why: the two generated files are still
//! independent Tera+SPARQL renders of the same query (this proof cannot
//! call `cli_boundary_tests.rs.tmpl`'s OWN render logic in-process — only
//! the RESULT it produces, read back off disk). It still reads the REAL,
//! already-rendered text of `tests/chicago_tdd_tools_boundary.rs` off disk
//! and asserts the query-derived literals appear in it verbatim. That
//! remaining gap (two renders of one query, not one render checked twice) is
//! a `ggen-engine` template-composition limitation (no import/no cross-
//! template artifact reuse today), not something this pack's own files can
//! close without touching shared engine code.
