# github-actions-pack

TCPS production-process pack for GitHub Actions. First-class pack, prefix
`gha: <http://seanchatmangpt.github.io/packs/github-actions#>`.

## The TCPS split

- `gh-terraform-pack` = 工場配置と管理標準 — Terraform is institutional state: what the
  factory (repos, teams, branch protection, secrets plumbing) *is*.
- `github-actions-pack` = 生産設備と工程標準 — Actions is the production process on events:
  what the factory *does* when a production obligation comes into existence.

## Four layers (ontology model)

1. **Event** — when a production obligation comes into existence (push, tag, PR,
   release-published, dispatch, merge_group, path filters).
2. **Workflow** — identity, purpose, inputs/outputs, secrets, concurrency, permission
   ceiling, evidence obligations, standing effect.
3. **Job + Step** — dependencies, runner, matrix, timeout, permissions, artifacts,
   evidence, failure classification. The model distinguishes step-executed ≠
   step-succeeded ≠ job-succeeded ≠ evidence-admitted ≠ standing-acquired.
4. **Production-output** — binary, test-report, docs, package, release-asset, SBOM,
   attestation, receipt, drift-report, standing-judgment.

## Refusals (gates)

Declared operations derive minimal `GITHUB_TOKEN` permissions. The pack REFUSES:
`write-all`; unspecified permissions (top-level and job-level both absent); unnecessary
`contents: write`; unbounded `pull_request_target`; mutable third-party action refs
(pinned 40-hex SHAs required); secret use without a declared reason.

## As-built inventory (origin/main `f775fbb8b`, 2026-07-20)

24 workflows. Full structured extraction in `SURVEY.md` (seed data for Build agents).
Ownership: `publish-candidate.yml` belongs to `ggen-release-pack`; `tcps-drift.yml`
(not yet on main) belongs to `gh-terraform-pack`; `tf-acceptance.yml` is hand-written —
this pack must not double-own any of them.

Security finding: 4 mutable action refs, all in `tf-acceptance.yml`
(`actions/checkout@v4`, `dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable`, `extractions/setup-just@v2`,
`hashicorp/setup-terraform@v3`). No `write-all`, no `pull_request_target` anywhere.

## Layout

- `pack.toml` — pack identity
- `ontology.ttl` — gha: individuals (Build agents)
- `gates/*.rq` — refusal gates, UNION + FILTER NOT EXISTS, namespace-scoped (Build agents)
- `templates/*.tmpl` — frontmatter `to:`/`sparql:` templates (Build agents)
- `SURVEY.md` — as-built seed data (this survey)
- Tier-1 proof: `crates/ggen-engine/tests/github_actions_pack_e2e.rs`

## Generated products (B3) and the shadow-retrofit sequence

Bodies live in `bodies.ttl` (separate file; consumers wire it via the pack entry's
`extra_ontologies = ["packs/github-actions-pack/bodies.ttl"]` — `ggen-engine`'s
`extra_ontology_paths` unions it after `ontology.ttl`). Products:

1. 検査 — `.github/workflows/reusable-rust-inspection.yml` (reusable `workflow_call`:
   fmt/lint/build/test/doctest + aggregate `inspection-status`, adapted from the real
   ci.yml/quality.yml; derived permissions `contents: read` only — no job creates check
   runs via the API, so `checks: write` is deliberately absent) +
   `docs/github-actions/inspection-caller-example.yml` (caller example, docs-only).
2. 受領 — `.github/actions/emit-evidence/action.yml` (delegates to the ggen-verify-pack
   evidence emitter contract; one implementation of the `ver:` fact format, zero drift).
3. `.github/actions/setup-ggen/action.yml` (release-asset-else-cargo-build bootstrap,
   from the tcps-drift.yml pattern).
4. Facts only: `tcps-drift.yml` → `gha:ownedBy "gh-terraform-pack"` (漂流検査);
   `publish-candidate.yml`/`release.yml` → `gha:ownedBy "ggen-release-pack"` (公開).

Shadow retrofit: generated products land BESIDE the handwritten ci.yml/quality.yml.
Sequence: (a) generate + commit the reusable workflow (done, inert until called);
(b) promote the caller example from `docs/github-actions/` into `.github/workflows/`;
(c) run both in shadow until results agree; (d) retire the duplicated jobs from the
handwritten ci.yml/quality.yml, keeping ci.yml's phase2/cargo-cicd/lsp-crates jobs.
