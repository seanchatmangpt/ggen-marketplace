#!/usr/bin/env bash
# dogfood-lifecycle-capture.sh — Operation Dogfood (v26.7.18) PostToolUse hook.
#
# Appends one dfl:ToolEvent Turtle node per tool event to
# <repo>/.cargo-cicd/lifecycle/session-<id>.ttl, conforming to
# packs/dogfood-lifecycle-pack/{ontology,shapes}.ttl. This is how Multifractal
# Workflow governs its own Claude Code lifecycle: every tool call becomes an
# admitted RDF observation the session-end recipe can validate + receipt.
#
# OBSERVATION ONLY. This hook records what a tool event did; it never asserts
# authority, permission, or actuation. Outcome is the TOOL-level result (Ok
# unless the tool itself errored); a dfl:Blocked outcome is asserted by
# hooks/cng-plan-admission-guard.sh (the PreToolUse guard), not here --
# PostToolUse structurally never fires for a call a PreToolUse hook blocked,
# so this hook's own "Blocked" branch is intentionally unreachable by
# design, not a bug (see hooks/dogfood-lib.sh's header for the full
# disclosure and README.md's "Actuation closure" section).
#
# BEST-EFFORT: any internal failure must never disrupt the session. Every step
# is guarded and the hook always exits 0.
#
# PARAMETERIZED TARGET (v26.7.18): the capture root is resolved via
# dogfood-lib.sh's dogfood_repo_root (honors $DOGFOOD_REPO_ROOT, else
# derives the repo root from this script's own location) -- no hardcoded
# /Users/sac/... path.
