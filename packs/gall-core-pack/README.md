# gall-core-pack

`gall-core-pack` is the constitutional ggen-first Gall checkpoint and execution
framework. A consumer declares its program, capability graph, dependency-closed
checkpoints, APS-grade work items, automation policy, evidence obligations,
exclusions, and optional release crown as RDF.

The ontology is the only authority. ggen manufactures the roadmap, dependency
graphs, Jira and GitHub tracker projections, coding-agent instructions,
operator CLI, scheduler, isolated agent worktrees, tracker convergence,
verification state, evidence snapshots, receipts, replay, CI workflow,
checkpoint evidence, standing ledger, and crown report.

## APS as executable work-package law

The Agile Protocol Specification informs the work-package semantics. It is not a
runtime dependency and not a second implementation repository.

Gall mechanizes its stable principles:

- lifecycle states become controlled `gall:ProtocolState` values;
- metadata richness becomes mandatory identity, release, checkpoint, component,
  role, priority, and order fields;
- context-driven development becomes `gall:requiredContext`;
- governance becomes explicit assignee, reviewer, and approval authority;
- transparency becomes mandatory objective and rationale;
- adversarial review becomes a required falsification question;
- auditability becomes commands, content-addressed evidence, and receipts;
- automation becomes generated tracker, agent, scheduler, replay, and CI
  surfaces.

The pack does not copy unfinished APS prose into tickets. It converts the stable
principles into graph constraints and generated consequences.

## Checkpoint contract

Every `gall:Checkpoint` must declare:

- one useful capability;
- one real runner command;
- exactly one positive witness;
- exactly one negative falsifier;
- exactly one receipt verifier;
- exactly one clean-replay command;
- every proof dependency;
- at least one implementation work item.

The generated checkpoint runner records reality. It does not promote itself.
SPARQL gates derive standing from admitted evidence on the next sync.

## Work-item contract

Every `gall:WorkItem` belongs to exactly one program and checkpoint. It must
contain enough information for a coding agent to execute without inventing
scope:

- stable identity and implementation order;
- controlled issue type, priority, and APS lifecycle state;
- objective and rationale;
- component, assignee role, reviewer role, and approval gate;
- dependencies and required context;
- allowed and forbidden write paths;
- one or more `MUST` rules;
- one or more `MUST NOT` rules;
- explicit out-of-scope behavior;
- acceptance criteria and definition of done;
- executable verification commands;
- repository evidence artifacts;
- adversarial questions.

Dependencies must be acyclic. Every prerequisite must have a lower
`gall:implementationOrder`. A cross-checkpoint dependency is legal only when the
checkpoint graph contains the corresponding proof dependency.

## Automation-profile contract

Every program with work items owns exactly one `gall:AutomationProfile`:

```turtle
ex:automation-profile a gall:AutomationProfile ;
    gall:automationProfileId "EX-AUTOMATION" ;
    gall:trackerProvider gall:FileTracker ;
    gall:executionMode gall:PlanOnly ;
    gall:agentMode gall:HandoffOnly ;
    gall:maxParallelism 4 ;
    gall:branchPattern "agent/{workItemId}" ;
    gall:runtimeDirectory ".gall" ;
    gall:receiptDirectory "receipts/gall" .
```

Allowed providers:

- `gall:JiraCloud`
- `gall:GitHubIssues`
- `gall:FileTracker`

Allowed actuation modes:

- `gall:PlanOnly`
- `gall:ApplyAllowed`

Allowed agent modes:

- `gall:HandoffOnly`
- `gall:CommandAgent`

Parallelism is bounded from 1 through 64. Branch patterns must include
`{workItemId}` and cannot escape through absolute or parent paths. Runtime and
receipt directories must remain project-relative and outside `.git`. Profile
identity is unique and one profile cannot govern multiple programs.

## Zero-unreceipted actuation

Every external mutation follows:

```text
admitted graph
→ deterministic plan
→ intent receipt
→ explicit apply boundary
→ external response
→ result receipt
→ independent receipt verification
```

Plan mode is credential-free. Network or agent actuation requires all of:

1. policy admits `gall:ApplyAllowed`;
2. the operator explicitly requests apply;
3. required environment credentials exist;
4. an intent receipt is durable before execution;
5. the result is recorded afterward.

Automation receipts form a SHA-256 predecessor chain bound to the generated
automation manifest and Git revision. The independent verifier recomputes every
digest, verifies receipt membership, rejects stale material, and at crown time
requires current-revision verification, evidence snapshot, and completion
receipts for every work item.

## Operator CLI

```bash
bash scripts/gall/gall automation plan
bash scripts/gall/gall automation validate
bash scripts/gall/gall work status
bash scripts/gall/gall work next
bash scripts/gall/gall work dispatch WORK_ITEM_ID
bash scripts/gall/gall work dispatch-ready
bash scripts/gall/gall work inspect WORK_ITEM_ID
bash scripts/gall/gall work remove-worktree WORK_ITEM_ID
bash scripts/gall/gall work verify WORK_ITEM_ID
bash scripts/gall/gall work complete WORK_ITEM_ID
bash scripts/gall/gall work advance
bash scripts/gall/gall tracker plan
bash scripts/gall/gall tracker apply
bash scripts/gall/gall checkpoint run
bash scripts/gall/gall receipt verify
bash scripts/gall/gall replay
bash scripts/gall/gall crown
```

`work next` returns only dependency-ready work, bounded by declared maximum
parallelism. `work advance` executes verification and evidence snapshots for all
ready items and emits completion receipts only for green work. `crown` refreshes
all work evidence in proof order at the exact sealed revision before checking
checkpoint and receipt closure.

## Coding-agent handoff and isolated invocation

A safe handoff bundle is always available:

```bash
bash scripts/gall/gall work dispatch EX-GALL-001
```

It contains a work order, exact branch, full ticket row, dependencies, paths,
verification, and a bundle digest.

External invocation additionally requires `gall:CommandAgent`, apply permission,
and:

```text
GALL_AGENT_COMMAND=/path/to/agent --fixed-arguments
```

Then:

```bash
bash scripts/gall/gall work dispatch EX-GALL-001 --apply
```

The public CLI creates a dedicated Git branch and isolated worktree, appends the
work-order path as the final agent argument, calculates the complete changed-file
set, refuses every forbidden or unauthorized path, runs the ticket verifiers in
the isolated worktree, and emits an intent/result receipt. It never merges or
pushes the branch automatically.

Use these commands for review and cleanup:

```bash
bash scripts/gall/gall work inspect EX-GALL-001
bash scripts/gall/gall work remove-worktree EX-GALL-001
```

Removal is refused while uncommitted changes remain.

## Tracker convergence

### File tracker

`gall:FileTracker` materializes one current Markdown work order per ticket under
the runtime directory. It is used by the real Chicago-TDD lifecycle without
network access.

### Jira Cloud

Required environment:

```text
JIRA_BASE_URL=https://your-domain.atlassian.net
JIRA_EMAIL=operator@example.com
JIRA_API_TOKEN=secret
```

Optional environment:

```text
JIRA_DEPENDENCY_LINK_TYPE=Blocks
GALL_JIRA_USE_COMPONENTS=1
GALL_JIRA_STATUS_MAP={"blocked":"Blocked","ready":"To Do","complete":"Done"}
```

The synchronizer searches by stable Gall identity, creates or updates issues,
inspects links before adding dependencies, and optionally converges lifecycle
through deployment-specific transition names.

### GitHub Issues

Required environment:

```text
GITHUB_TOKEN=secret
GITHUB_REPOSITORY=owner/repository
```

The synchronizer creates deterministic labels before issue upsert, identifies
each issue through its stable Gall label, updates the full work order, and closes
the issue only after a Gall completion receipt exists.

## Generated GitHub Actions workflow

Pull requests execute plan, source validation, ready-queue calculation, replay,
and receipt verification. `workflow_dispatch` can independently request:

- verification and completion of ready work;
- external tracker application;
- one coding-agent handoff or isolated invocation;
- automation crown verification.

Tracker and agent jobs use the `gall-external-actuation` environment so repository
approval rules can protect credentials and execution.

## Planning and crown modes

### Planning mode

Declare the program, checkpoints, work items, and automation profile without a
crown. `ggen sync run` validates the graph and manufactures all planning,
execution, and automation surfaces. Missing execution evidence remains
`UNKNOWN`.

### Crown mode

A declared crown activates hard release gates. Every checkpoint must be included
and dependency-closed. Every checkpoint needs green exact-revision evidence,
and every work item needs current-revision verification, content-addressed
evidence, and completion receipts. The automation crown also requires the
checkpoint ledger to derive `ALIVE` and the receipt chain to verify against the
current manifest.

## Consumer wiring

```toml
[project]
name = "my-gall-program"

[ontology]
source = "ontology.ttl"

[packs]
gall-core-pack = { path = "../packs/gall-core-pack" }

[templates]
dir = "templates"

[law]
reflexive = true
```

After the first planning sync:

```bash
ggen sync run
git add .
git commit -m "seal Gall planning artifacts"
bash scripts/gall/gall automation validate
bash scripts/gall/gall work dispatch-ready
```

The checkpoint runner creates an evidence mini-pack. Wire it unlocked:

```toml
[packs]
gall-core-pack = { path = "../packs/gall-core-pack" }
gall-evidence = { path = "evidence/gall", lock = false }
```

Then activate the crown, seal the exact revision, rerun evidence, sync, and check
closure:

```bash
ggen sync run
git add .
git commit -m "seal Gall crown inputs"
bash scripts/gall/gall checkpoint run
ggen sync run
bash scripts/gall/gall crown
```

## Non-self-certification boundary

The pack deliberately separates:

1. ggen generation and graph admission;
2. real shell, filesystem, Git, tracker, and optional agent boundaries;
3. observed receipts and content-addressed evidence;
4. independent receipt and crown verification.

Neither the generated runner nor the control plane may directly assert `ALIVE`.
A consumer that authors `gall:declaredStanding` is refused by name.
