# ggen-marketplace: push or delete local-only branch `pack/port-bridge`

- Standing: OPEN
- Created: 2026-09-19 (v26.9.19 gh survey wave)
- Source: local branch `pack/port-bridge` has 3 commit(s) not on `origin/main`, no upstream
- Evidence: `git rev-list --count origin/main..pack/port-bridge` = 3

## Work to complete
- Push (`git push -u origin pack/port-bridge`) if the work matters; otherwise delete the branch after confirming the commits are obsolete.

## Acceptance
- Branch pushed and visible on GitHub, or deleted locally with commits confirmed recoverable-or-unwanted.
